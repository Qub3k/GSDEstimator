# GSD Estimator

Estimator for [Generalized Score Distibution's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04369) parameters using OpenCL for accelerating calculation on GPI.

## Build process
In case of doubts refere to [wiki page](https://github.com/srokadev/GSDEstimator/wiki).

### Requirements
For windows you'll need Visual Studio Build Tools.
For linux and Mac OS X just these `g++` `make` `cmake` should be enough.

**Note for Mac OS X users**: You can install `gcc` through [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc#default).

**Note for M1 CPU users**: The code will not work on your machine. ðŸ˜…

### Command sequence

```
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**Note for Mac OS X users**: `cmake` will, by default, use the AppleClang compiler. You need to manually instruct it to use the GCC compiler instead.
To do so, prepend all calls to `cmake` with the following:
```
CC=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/11.1.0_1/bin/gcc-11 CXX=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/gcc/11.1.0_1/bin/g++-11
```
(Make sure to adapt the line above according to your GCC installation.)

For linux the final executable named GSDEsimator will end up in build directory.
For windows you will find it in build/Release directory.

## Usage

```
Usage: ./GSDEstimator <samples_file> [output_file]
	samples_file: name of input file containg samples for estimation
	output_file: name of csv file containing results
```

- samples file is a text file with each sample in new line. Every sample consits of 5 values from subjective experiments utilizing the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) technique, with possible answers {1,2,â‹¯,5} 
- output file will be a csv file with results decribed by values
  - `idx` - index of sample
  - `psi` - estimated mean (rating)
  - `rho` - estimated variance
  - `log_likelihood` - logarithm of likelihood value
